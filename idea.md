"Greg's Cake Quest" is a 2D arcade-style game where players control a character in an open environment, racing to collect cake pieces while avoiding a mischievous mouse.

## Storyline:
TO BE DONE

## Game Objective
Assist Greg in collecting scattered cake pieces across level while dodging mouse, enhancing both the strategic and quick reflex skills of players.

## Gameplay Mechanics:
- **Cake Collection:** The primary goal level is to collect all the cake pieces.
- **Scoring System:** Players earn points based on the number of cakes collected.
- **Avoiding the Mouse:** The mouse moves around the environment in two modes.
In the first mode, the mouse tries to eat the pieces of cake before the player can collect them.
In the second mode, the mouse tries to steal the cake from the player; if it succeeds, one piece of cake disappears from the player's plate.
The mode switching is random, after a random number of successful attempts by the mouse to pick up the cake, or to pick it up from the player.
Along with the cake appearing in the board through a random process, the process makes the game more challenging.
